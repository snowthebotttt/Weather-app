# Weather Dashboard App

## Description

Challenge six of the boot camp required me to create a weather dashboard app. The app allows users to search for a city and view its current and future weather conditions. The searched city is added to the search history.

The current weather conditions for the city show its name, date, and wind speed. The future weather conditions for the city display a 5-day forecast with the date, an icon representing the weather conditions, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

Users can click on the search history to view the current and future weather conditions for a previously searched city.
